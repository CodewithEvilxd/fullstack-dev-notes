## Performance Calculations

### 1. QPS (Queries Per Second) Calculation
```
Daily Active Users: 1,000,000
Average requests per user per day: 10
Peak hours: 20% of daily traffic

Daily requests: 1,000,000 × 10 = 10,000,000
Peak hourly requests: 10,000,000 × 0.2 = 2,000,000
Peak QPS: 2,000,000 / 3,600 = ~556 QPS
```

### 2. Storage Calculation
```
Users: 1,000,000
Data per user per month: 10MB
Retention: 5 years

Monthly storage: 1,000,000 × 10MB = 10TB
Annual storage: 10TB × 12 = 120TB
5-year storage: 120TB × 5 = 600TB
With replication (3x): 1.8PB
```

### 3. Bandwidth Calculation
```
Average response size: 500KB
Peak QPS: 556
Peak bandwidth: 556 × 500KB = 278MB/s = 2.22Gbps
```

### 4. Server Calculation
```
Requests per second: 556
Average response time: 200ms
CPU cores needed: (556 × 0.2) / 0.7 ≈ 159 cores
```

## Database Design Patterns

└── Load balancing
```

### 2. Write-Heavy Workloads

```

### 4. Global Applications
```
Pattern: Multi-region replication

└── Compliance considerations
```

## Caching Strategies

### 1. Application-Level Caching
```python
# Cache-aside pattern
def get_user(user_id):
    # Check cache first
    user = cache.get(f"user:{user_id}")
    if user:
        return user

    # Cache miss - fetch from database
    user = db.query("SELECT * FROM users WHERE id = ?", user_id)
    if user:
        cache.set(f"user:{user_id}", user, ttl=3600)
    return user
```

### 2. Database-Level Caching
```sql
-- MySQL query cache
SET GLOBAL query_cache_size = 268435456;
SET GLOBAL query_cache_type = ON;

-- Redis as cache store
redis-cli
SET user:123 '{"name": "John", "email": "john@example.com"}'
EXPIRE user:123 3600
GET user:123
```

### 3. Multi-Level Caching
```
L1: Application Cache (Caffeine) - 1ms latency
L2: Distributed Cache (Redis) - 5ms latency
L3: CDN Cache - 50ms latency
L4: Database - 100ms latency

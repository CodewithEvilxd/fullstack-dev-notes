# Fault Tolerance and High Availability

## Fault Tolerance

### What is Fault Tolerance?
Fault tolerance is the ability of a system to continue operating properly in the event of failures of some of its components. It involves designing systems that can detect failures and recover from them automatically.

### Types of Faults

#### Hardware Faults
- Disk failures
- Memory corruption
- Network interface failures
- Power supply failures

#### Software Faults
- Bugs in application code
- Configuration errors
- Resource exhaustion
- Dependency failures

#### Human Faults
- Misconfigurations
- Accidental data deletion
- Security breaches

#### Network Faults
- Network partitions
- Packet loss
- High latency
- DNS failures

### Fault Tolerance Patterns

#### Redundancy
- Duplicate critical components
- Multiple instances of services
- Backup systems ready to take over

#### Replication
- Data replication across multiple nodes
- Service replication for load distribution
- Geographic replication for disaster recovery

#### Monitoring and Alerting
- Continuous health monitoring
- Automated alerting for anomalies
- Proactive issue detection

#### Graceful Degradation
- System continues with reduced functionality
- Non-critical features disabled during failures
- User experience maintained at acceptable level

## High Availability

### What is High Availability?
High availability (HA) refers to systems that are operational and accessible for a high percentage of time, typically measured as a percentage of uptime.

### Availability Metrics

#### Uptime Percentage
- **99% (3 nines)**: 8.77 hours downtime per year
- **99.9% (4 nines)**: 8.77 hours downtime per year
- **99.99% (5 nines)**: 52.6 minutes downtime per year
- **99.999% (6 nines)**: 5.26 minutes downtime per year

#### Mean Time Between Failures (MTBF)
- Average time between system failures
- Higher MTBF indicates more reliable system

#### Mean Time To Recovery (MTTR)
- Average time to recover from failures
- Lower MTTR improves availability

#### Availability Formula
```
Availability = MTBF / (MTBF + MTTR)
```

### High Availability Architectures

#### Active-Passive (Failover)
```
┌─────────────┐
│   Active    │ ← Traffic
│   System    │
└─────────────┘
       │
┌─────────────┐
│   Passive   │ ← Standby
│   System    │
└─────────────┘
```

- One system active, one passive
- Passive takes over when active fails
- Manual or automatic failover

#### Active-Active
```
┌─────────────┐ ┌─────────────┐
│   System A  │ │   System B  │ ← Traffic
│   (Active)   │ │  (Active)   │
└─────────────┘ └─────────────┘
```

- Both systems active simultaneously
- Load distributed between systems
- Higher capacity and utilization

#### Multi-Site Deployment
```
┌─────────────────┐ ┌─────────────────┐
│   Primary Site  │ │  Secondary Site │
│                 │ │                 │
│ ┌─────────────┐ │ │ ┌─────────────┐ │
│ │  System A   │ │ │ │  System A   │ │
│ └─────────────┘ │ │ └─────────────┘ │
│ ┌─────────────┐ │ │ ┌─────────────┐ │
│ │  System B   │ │ │ │  System B   │ │
│ └─────────────┘ │ │ └─────────────┘ │
└─────────────────┘ └─────────────────┘
```

- Systems deployed across multiple data centers
- Geographic redundancy
- Disaster recovery capability

### Load Balancing for HA

#### DNS-Based Load Balancing
```
www.example.com → DNS Server
                      │
               ┌──────┼──────┐
               │      │      │
            Server A  Server B  Server C
```

- Multiple IP addresses for same domain
- Client-side load distribution
- Simple but limited control

#### Hardware Load Balancers
- Dedicated hardware appliances
- Advanced load balancing algorithms
- SSL termination and health checks

#### Software Load Balancers
- NGINX, HAProxy, Envoy
- Flexible configuration
- Cost-effective

### Database High Availability

#### Master-Slave Replication
```
┌─────────────┐
│   Master    │ ← Writes
│  Database   │
└─────────────┘
       ↓
┌─────────────┐ ┌─────────────┐
│   Slave 1   │ │   Slave 2   │ ← Reads
│  Database   │ │  Database   │
└─────────────┘ └─────────────┘
```

- Master handles all writes
- Slaves handle read traffic
- Automatic failover to slave

#### Multi-Master Replication
```
┌─────────────┐ ↔ ┌─────────────┐
│   Master 1  │   │   Master 2  │
│  Database   │   │  Database   │
└─────────────┘   └─────────────┘
       ↑               ↑
    Writes          Writes
```

- Multiple masters accept writes
- Conflict resolution required
- Higher write availability

#### Database Clustering
```
┌─────────────┐ ┌─────────────┐ ┌─────────────┐
│   Node 1    │ │   Node 2    │ │   Node 3    │
│  Database   │ │  Database   │ │  Database   │
└─────────────┘ └─────────────┘ └─────────────┘
       ↔             ↔             ↔
    Shared Storage / Replication
```

- Multiple database nodes
- Automatic failover
- Load distribution

### Circuit Breaker Pattern

#### How Circuit Breaker Works
```
Closed → Open → Half-Open → Closed
   ↑       ↑       ↑         ↑
   │       │       │         │
Normal  Failure  Recovery  Success
State   Threshold  Test     Test
```

- **Closed**: Normal operation, requests pass through
- **Open**: Failure threshold reached, requests fail fast
- **Half-Open**: Test if service recovered
- **Closed**: Service recovered, normal operation

#### Benefits
- Prevent cascade failures
- Fast failure detection
- Automatic recovery
- Resource conservation

### Retry and Timeout Patterns

#### Exponential Backoff
```
Attempt 1: Immediate retry
Attempt 2: 1 second delay
Attempt 3: 2 second delay
Attempt 4: 4 second delay
Attempt 5: 8 second delay
```

- Progressive delay between retries
- Reduce server load during failures
- Prevent thundering herd problem

#### Jitter
```
Base Delay + Random Jitter
```

- Add randomness to retry delays
- Distribute retry attempts over time
- Reduce simultaneous retry spikes

#### Timeout Settings
- Connection timeout
- Read timeout
- Write timeout
- Appropriate timeout values prevent hanging requests

### Monitoring and Alerting

#### Health Checks
- Application health endpoints
- Database connectivity checks
- External service dependencies
- Infrastructure monitoring

#### Metrics to Monitor
- Response times
- Error rates
- Throughput
- Resource utilization (CPU, memory, disk)
- Network latency

#### Alerting Strategies
- Immediate alerts for critical failures
- Escalation policies
- On-call rotations
- Automated remediation

### Disaster Recovery

#### Recovery Time Objective (RTO)
- Maximum acceptable time to restore system
- Determines backup frequency and recovery procedures

#### Recovery Point Objective (RPO)
- Maximum acceptable data loss
- Determines backup and replication strategies

#### Disaster Recovery Strategies
- **Backup and Restore**: Periodic backups, manual recovery
- **Pilot Light**: Minimal infrastructure always running
- **Warm Standby**: Scaled-down version of production
- **Multi-Site Active-Active**: Full production in multiple sites

### Chaos Engineering

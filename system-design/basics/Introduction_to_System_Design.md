# Introduction to System Design

## What is System Design?

System design is the process of defining the architecture, components, modules, interfaces, and data for a system to satisfy specified requirements. It involves transforming user requirements into a detailed blueprint that guides the implementation of the system.

## Key Principles

### 1. Scalability
The ability of a system to handle increased load by adding resources to the system.

### 2. Reliability
The ability of a system to continue operating correctly even when failures occur.

### 3. Availability
The proportion of time that the system is functional and working.

### 4. Maintainability
How easily a system can be modified to correct faults, improve performance, or adapt to changing requirements.

### 5. Performance
How efficiently the system uses resources to achieve its goals.

## Basic Components of a System

### Client
- User interface
- Sends requests to the server
- Receives and displays responses

### Server
- Processes requests from clients
- Manages business logic
- Handles data storage and retrieval

### Database
- Stores and manages data
- Provides data persistence
- Handles concurrent access

### Network
- Connects clients and servers
- Handles data transmission
- Manages security and routing

## System Design Process

1. **Requirements Gathering**: Understand what the system needs to do
2. **Analysis**: Break down requirements into functional and non-functional requirements
3. **Design**: Create high-level and detailed designs
4. **Implementation**: Build the system according to the design
5. **Testing**: Verify that the system meets requirements
6. **Deployment**: Make the system available to users
7. **Maintenance**: Keep the system running and improve it over time

## Common Design Patterns

### Layered Architecture
```
Presentation Layer (UI)
    ↓
Business Logic Layer
    ↓
Data Access Layer
    ↓
Database
```

### MVC Pattern
```
Model (Data)
    ↕
View (UI) ← Controller (Logic)
```

## Basic Scalability Concepts

### Vertical Scaling (Scale Up)
- Adding more power to existing server
- CPU, RAM, storage upgrades
- Limited by hardware constraints

### Horizontal Scaling (Scale Out)
- Adding more servers to the system
- Distributing load across multiple machines
- More flexible and cost-effective for large systems

## Key Metrics to Monitor

- Response Time
- Throughput
- Error Rate
- Resource Utilization (CPU, Memory, Disk)
- Network Latency

## Tools and Technologies

- Load Testing: JMeter, LoadRunner
- Monitoring: Prometheus, Grafana
- Version Control: Git
- Documentation: Draw.io, Lucidchart

## Best Practices

1. Start with simple designs and iterate
2. Design for failure
3. Use appropriate data structures and algorithms
4. Consider security from the beginning
5. Document your decisions and trade-offs
6. Plan for future growth

## Common Pitfalls

- Over-engineering simple problems
- Ignoring non-functional requirements
- Not considering edge cases
- Poor documentation
- Lack of testing

Remember: System design is iterative. Start simple, measure performance, and scale as needed.
